· **Python** code downloads real lightcurves of different variable stars (Cepheid, Exoplane transit, Supernova) from NASA’s **Kepler** and **K2** mission data. It generates CSV files with the curves, and WAV files representing them.

· **Processing** code creates an animation from the CSV curves, showing the curve and playing their sound.
